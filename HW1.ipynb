    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of four are not allowed and you are more than welcome to form groups of two.\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",

    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "If a topic was not covered in detail during the lecture, you are asked to study it online on your own. \n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, , the code has a **DEBUG** mode that you may use in order to debug with toy data.  \n",
    "It is recommended to solve the code in that mode (with efficiency in mind) and then run the code on all the data.\n",
