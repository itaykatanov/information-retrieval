# information-retrieval
This is a project for information retrieval system.
For your convenience, , the code has a DEBUG mode that you may use in order to debug with toy data.
It is recommended to solve the code in that mode (with efficiency in mind) and then run the code on all the data. Do not forget to file the HW with DEBUG == False.

Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics and put it in the same directory your script is.

We use Python 3.7 for programming.
Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.
